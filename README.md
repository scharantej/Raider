## Flask Application Design

### HTML Files

- **index.html**: This is the main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the user. It typically contains the navigation bar, page layout, and placeholder sections for dynamic content.
- **detail.html**: This HTML file is used to display detailed information about a specific entity, such as a product or a blog post. It typically includes additional information and images not present in the main listing page.
- **form.html**: This HTML file is used to collect user input through a form. It includes form elements such as text fields, drop-down menus, and submit buttons.
- **success.html**: This HTML file is used to display a confirmation or success message after a user action has been successfully completed.

### Routes

- **@app.route('/')**: This route is associated with the **index.html** file and is typically used to display the main page of the application.
- **@app.route('/details/<id>')**: This route accepts a dynamic parameter **id** and is associated with the **detail.html** file. It is used to display detailed information about the entity with the specified **id**.
- **@app.route('/form', methods=['GET', 'POST'])**: This route is associated with the **form.html** file. It handles both GET (for displaying the form) and POST (for processing form submissions) requests.
- **@app.route('/success')**: This route is associated with the **success.html** file and is typically used to display a confirmation or success message after a form submission or other user action.
